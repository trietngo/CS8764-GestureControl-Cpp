# CS8674-GestureControl-Cpp
An exploration and implementation of gesture control using C++ and OpenCV. Supervised by Dr. Scott Valcourt of the Roux Institute at Northeastern University.

Fist and Hand Models acquired from Sandeep Sthapit: https://github.com/Sandeep-Sthapit/HandGestureDetection

How to run the detection program from the terminal:
1. Make sure OpenCV and CMake are installed on your system. Currently, only Windows is supported.
2. Create a build folder: "mkdir build". Then access the folder: "cd build"
3. Replace the Fist and Hand Models paths with those from the Resource folder in your system.
4. Type "cmake .." to initialize the Makefile
5. Type "./GestureControl" to run the program. Allow access as needed.
